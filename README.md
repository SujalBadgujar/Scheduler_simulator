**Scheduling Algorithm Simulator**

This repository contains an implementation of the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) and Shortest-Job-First (SJF) scheduling algorithms in C++. The program schedules processes based on the process algorithms and calculates key metrics.

**Features**
Scheduling: Processes are scheduled by process algorithms.
Metrics: Calculates average turnaround time, waiting time, CPU utilization, and I/O utilization.

**Usage**

Compile the program:
          g++ -o fcfs FCFS-schedular.cpp
          
Run the program:
          ./fcfs
          
Input the number of processes, arrival time, and burst time for each process.
